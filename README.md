# Heating tanks problem

This project aims to solve a problem of placing heating tanks next to homes. The amount of tanks should be equal to the number of homes. Each house has to be connected with at least one tank, only edge connections count. Tanks must not be connected to each other (with neither edges nor corners). Numbers on the edges of the board tell how many tanks should each column or row contain. Each puzzle has exactly one solution.

An example problem with solution is presented below:
